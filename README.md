# qarl
Python library for Quantile Assessment using Reinforcement Learning (RL).

# key features
* estimation under poor supervising (guesses of the agent are corrected only by boolean feedback "less" or "greater")
* openendedness (estimation of non-stationary distributions)
* estimation of distribution of random variable
* estimation of distribution of non-stationary stochastic variable
